Delicately selected by Gil, but only really chose 6. Hope it's perfect.

## Get Started

1. Clone repo, go to the directory and enter terminal command: `npm install`
2. It helps to have mongodb globally installed, but it should work if you don't.
3. `npm start` should build it out with webpack.
4. go to ~> localhost:3000
5. Click the button, if you're not happy with the name, click until you're happy.
